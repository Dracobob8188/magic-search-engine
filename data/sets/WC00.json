The deck used artifacts such as Grim Monolith, Metalworker, and Voltaic Key to quickly generate huge amounts of mana, and then used that mana to put large creatures into play.","type":"Card","supertypes":[],"types":["Card"],"subtypes":[],"uuid":"0b59fd3c-0253-500e-82e8-39e5f04061a1","reverseRelated":[],"signature":"Jon Finkel"},{"colors":[],"layout":"token","identifiers":{"scryfallId":"170c4817-104c-4a10-a796-6e62c5104920","scryfallOracleId":"5ebd7be1-d3d9-4765-90c2-f88808e313ab","mtgjsonV4Id":"1bbfafd7-f22f-5df9-9db5-c730514d54ce"},"name":"Janosch Kühn Decklist (2000)","language":"English","setCode":"WC00","borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"finishes":["nonfoil"],"frameVersion":"1997","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"number":"jk0b","availability":["paper"],"asciiName":"Janosch Kuhn Decklist (2000)","type":"Card","supertypes":[],"types":["Card"],"subtypes":[],"uuid":"6b10846b-479e-55ef-a911-8c31e08f005c","reverseRelated":[]},{"colors":[],"layout":"token","identifiers":{"scryfallId":"260e570f-e86f-4c7f-ae69-c601de1405d8","scryfallOracleId":"0ba72b8a-56aa-45be-9628-73825b506bba","mtgjsonV4Id":"f5a60d70-a395-53bb-9a69-516153e4c777"},"name":"Nicolas Labarre Bio","language":"English","setCode":"WC00","borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"finishes":["nonfoil","signed"],"frameVersion":"1997","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"number":"nl0a","availability":["paper"],"text":"The 2000 World Championships was Nicolas Labarre's third Top 8 finish at a Pro Tour™ event (Rome '98, New York '99, Worlds '00).
