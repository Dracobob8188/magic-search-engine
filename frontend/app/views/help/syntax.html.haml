%h3 Search Help

%div
  Most syntax from magiccards.info works here. Everything is case insensitive. All Unicode characters like "Ã†" can be spelled with their plain equivalents like "Ae" as well.

%h4 Search by name
%ul
  = search_help "channel", %Q[cards with "channel" in name]
  = search_help "!channel", %Q[cards with name exactly "channel" (only works as complete query)]

%h4 Search by mana cost
%div For sake of this search every mana symbol is treated as non-comparable, so "{u}" is neither greater or less than "{u/b}" etc. There's a lot of flexibility, so "{up}", "{u/p}", "{P/U}" etc. all work for Phyrexian blue mana. Curly braces are only needed for non-standard mana types.
